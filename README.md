This is Collection of Tutorials and hands on projects on following Deep Learning techniques:

# Supervised Deep learning:
1. Artificial Neural Networks: Analysis of unusual Churn Rate: Artificial Neural Networks were deployed using Keras to analyse the Churn
Rate to determine the group of customers who were about to close accounts in a particular bank.<br>
2. Convolutional Neural Networks: To detect cats and dogs from a picture.<br>
3. Recurrent Neural Networks: Using Keras to deploy LSTMs to predict Google stock prices.<br>

# Unsupervised Deep learning:
1. Self Organizing Maps for fraud detection: Used Self Organising Maps (SOMs) to determine the frauds from credit card applicantsâ€™
data, then used Recurrent Neural Networks to find the most probable frauds who got away with a credit card.<br>
2. Boltzmann Machines: Boltzmann Machines and were deployed in pytorch to build a
movie recommender system based on 1 million user ratings(if the person likes the movie or not).<br>
3. AutoEncoders: Autoencoders were deployed in pytorch to build a
movie recommender system based on 1 million user ratings(To predict the ratings for an unknown user out of 5).
